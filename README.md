</p>

1. **User Input:** The user writes a new SQL query in the editor or selects a predefined query.
2. **Query Execution:** The query is processed and executed.
3. **Result Handling:** The executed query returns a result set, which can be sorted based on different columns.
4. **Query History Management:** Successfully executed queries are stored in history for future reference.
5. **History Actions:** Users can rerun past queries or delete them from history as needed.

## ðŸ“Œ Application Architecture

</p>

MockQL follows a modular and scalable architecture with the following components:

- **Query Input & Execution:**
  - Users can input queries manually or select from predefined queries.
  - The query is entered into the SQL editor.
- **Query Processing & History Management:**
  - The query is executed and stored in history for reruns or deletion.
  - Lazy loading optimizes performance by only loading necessary components when required.
- **CSV Selection & Parsing:**
  - The system checks if the table name in the query matches a predefined CSV file.
  - Web Workers handle CSV processing asynchronously to ensure UI responsiveness.
- **State Management & Query Result Handling:**
  - The selected CSV file is parsed, and the query result is set.
  - React Hooks efficiently update state without unnecessary re-renders.
- **Rendering Results Efficiently:**
  - Virtualized result table displays processed data using react-window.
  - Lazy loading ensures only visible rows are rendered, improving performance for large datasets.

## ðŸ“Œ Performance & Optimizations

MockQL is optimized for high performance using:

- **Web Workers:** Parsing large CSV files in a separate thread to prevent UI blocking.
- **Virtualized Tables:** Efficiently rendering large datasets using react-window.
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Reducing initial load time by loading components on demand.
- **Optimized Event Handling with useCallback:** Prevents unnecessary re-creation of functions, improving performance in query execution and result table interactions.

## ðŸ“Œ Lighthouse Performance Scores

- **Navigation Test:** High efficiency for seamless navigation.
- **Timespan Test:** Optimized response times for query execution.
- **Snapshot Test:** Smooth UI rendering and interactions.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

MockQL is a powerful, user-friendly SQL query execution tool designed for efficiency and usability. With advanced features like query history, virtualized rendering, and Web Worker-based parsing, it offers a seamless and high-performance experience. Its modular architecture ensures scalability, making it an ideal solution for executing and managing SQL queries in real-time environments.
